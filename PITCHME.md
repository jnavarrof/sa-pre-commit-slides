## The easiest way to keep your repository tidy

# The Challenge
When developing collaboratively, we typically use git for version control and commit any changes to a feature branch that is reviewed before merging into the main codebase.

The **problem is nothing stops us from committing *low-quality* code** to the repository.

Low-quality code could include:

- code that is non compliant
- contains unused imports
- references to variables before assignment
- code that is failing on basic validation and liting steps

# <!--fit--> Why `pre-commit hooks`?

* Validation and linting are Best Practices
* Helps running linting and validation tests
* The number of [available checks](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) is extensive
* Easy step towards *shifting left* with security
* Simple integration with CI/CD pipelines

---
# Prepare your environment
Install `pre-commit` tool

```bash
$ pip install pre-commit
```

Add an initial `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your repository.

```bash
$ pre-commit sample-config > .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

---
# Basic `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
File should look something like this:

```yaml
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: check-added-large-files
```

---
# Install & Run locallly
Install all (and optionally update) all *git hooks*

```bash
$ pre-commit autoupdate
$ pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

and run over all files

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---
# Create a GitHub Action
To use with GitHub Actions, make a file `.github/workflwos/pre-commit.yml`. Use following template to get started.

```yaml
---
name: pre-commit
on:
  push:

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0
```
